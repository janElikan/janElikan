## Hello, world
My name is jan Elikan.

I'm trying to externalize my brain and keep as much of it as I can public, you can find my working notes [here](https://janelikan.github.io).

Here's the [list of projects that I'm currently working on](https://janelikan.github.io/now/).

I don't really know how to talk to people (which you can see by how badly this is written), so I want to get feedback on literally everything. Please create an issue or [email](mailto://janelikan@proton.me) if you have any!

Also I don't know how to draw, hence no logo or pfp yet.
