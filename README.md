## Hello, world
My name is jan Elikan ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): `/jan'elikan/`).

I'm trying to externalize my brain and keep as much of it as I can public, you can find my working notes [here](https://janelikan.github.io).

Here's the [list of projects that I'm currently working on](https://janelikan.github.io/now/).

I don't really know how to talk to people, so I want to get feedback on literally everything. Please create an issue or [email](mailto:janelikan@proton.me) if you have any!

Also I don't know how to draw, which you can probably tell by the logo :)
